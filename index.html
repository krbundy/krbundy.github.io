			<h2>Data Mining with R and Selenium</h2>
				<p>
					This project downloaded the text of about 120,000 comments on proposed Title IX rules changes from the US Department of Education website.  This data was then used by researchers at George Washington University to determine public sentiment about the rules changes and extract the comments with legal arguments.

				<h2>Time Series Prediction with Python and TensorFlow</h2>
				<p>
					This Jupyter Notebook creates a number of models to predict the incoming solar radiation on a solar panel.  The models include baselines like repeating the most recent observation, TBATS (Trigonometric, Box-Cox, Autoregrssive Moving Average with Trend and Seasonality), and multiple LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) models of different breadth and depth.

				<h2>Reinforcement Learning for network routing</h2>
				<p>This is a multi-agent Reinforcement learning project with the Wireless Sensor networks Laboratory (WiSe-Net) at the University of Maine, Orono.  This project uses, in its current iteration, multiple deep Q networks to control wireless traffic routing in star networks.  The code is extensible to many agents, though convergence issue may appear for very large numbers of nodes.  Further work improving network performance and experimenting with inverse Reinforcement learning approaches is ongoing.

					Wireless Communication Channel State Modeling with Deep Learning in MATLAB
				</h2>
				<p>
					This script is used to predict the channel state in a wireless communication channel.  This allows the node to save power by not transmitting data when the transmission will not reach its intended target.

				<h2>Student Grade Calculator using Python, Flask, and Microsoft Azure</h2>
				<p>
					When you are teaching, there is a real problem: students don't understand weighted averages.  Most college freshmen are not able to compute their grade from the course syllabus.  To address this, I created a grade calculator for the MAT 116 course at the University of Maine, Orono.
