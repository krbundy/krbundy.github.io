			<h2>Data Mining with R and Selenium</h2>
			<p>
					This project downloaded the text of about 120,000 comments on proposed Title IX rules changes from the US Department of Education website.  This data was then used by researchers at George Washington University to determine public sentiment about the rules changes and extract the comments with legal arguments.

				<h2>Time Series Prediction with Python and TensorFlow</h2>
				<p>
					This Jupyter Notebook creates a number of models to predict the incoming solar radiation on a solar panel.  The models include baselines like repeating the most recent observation, TBATS (Trigonometric, Box-Cox, Autoregrssive Moving Average with Trend and Seasonality), and multiple LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) models of different breadth and depth.
