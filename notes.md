* Something related to Lecospec - what?  Animate?  Powerpoint?
* Something related to IWIN - Sensor System / Diagrams?  Graph traversal game?

## Updates
* remove old code (and anything LSTM-y)
* Update skills to add:
    * Docker (huge)
    * Redis
    * Javascript/ TypeScript
    * Node.JS
    * Svelte or something
* Change to be more Resume-y
    * follow the same flow as a resume
    * see organization below


## New Outline
1. Title 
2. Summary (1 sentence or so)
3. Projects (links) - full width, shrink on hover.  Heading and text on each one
4. Skills (maybe 3, since flashy)
5. Text-heavy details (Education, About Me, etc.)



# Shiny ideas:
* App to calculate the Cosine Distance between a job add and my resume?  Or something like that
