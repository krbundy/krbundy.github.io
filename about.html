                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in a small farming town; we were on the main road through town and could get to a grocery store in about twenty minutes.  If you wanted a 'city' feel, that was close to an hour away.  From here, I went to the University of Maine, Orono, for my undergraduate and graduate work.  I took some time between them to work in tech support and at a hotel; both were interesting jobs but I knew those were temporary positions when I took them (really, they were seasonal).

                Until recently, I was teaching as a lecturer at the University of Maine at Augusta.  While I learned a lot about interacting with people and collaborating with coworkers from a distance, I realized that teaching was not my passion.  Instead, I am pursuing a career in data science.  I have always loved technology, mathematics, and learning new things, so data science seems like a natural fit.  
            </p>

                I am the type of person who is always learning something new.  Right now, that's Apache Spark.
